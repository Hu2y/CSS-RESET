# app-reset.css
A minimal CSS reset specifically for web applications

# Why use app-reset.css?
Every time I make something 'appy' I have to switch off or reset a bunch of user agent styles so that I can use the correct element for the job at hand but style it inline with the project I'm building.

App-reset is intended specifically for web applications.

# Accessibility Notes
These resets target HTML elements that typically receive styling defaults by User Agents that I always need to 'undo'.

Be aware that some of these resets have a negative impact on the default usability and accessibility of a web page. Therefore, ensure you add an equivalent accessible style back that matches your project aesthetic.
